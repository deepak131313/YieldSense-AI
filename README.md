🌾 AgriSense - Crop Yield Prediction System

An AI-driven precision agriculture platform designed to predict crop yields with high accuracy by integrating machine learning with deep agronomic domain knowledge. Built for farmers, agronomists, and researchers to optimize land productivity.

🚀 Key Features
Multi-Crop Support: Tailored predictions for Rice, Tea, Rubber, Sugarcane, and Cinnamon.
Agronomic Intelligence: Incorporates "Good Zone" indicators, heat stress, drought risk, and nutrient balance (NPK) analysis.
Real-time Analytics: Interactive dashboards showing model performance, feature importance, and historical trends.
Secure Data Storage: Integration with Supabase for persistent storage of prediction history.
Responsive UI: A premium, mobile-first frontend built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
ML Interpretability: Visualizes the top factors affecting every single prediction.

🧠 Agronomic Domain Logic
Unlike standard regressions, this system applies agricultural constraints to prevent unrealistic predictions:

Optimization Zones: Models are sensitized to optimal ranges (e.g., Tea performs best between 18-26°C).
Stress Penalties: Automatically identifies and accounts for drought stress (low rain + high temp) and nutrient imbalances.
Non-Negative Constraints: Post-processing layer ensures yields never drop below 0, regardless of extreme input data.
